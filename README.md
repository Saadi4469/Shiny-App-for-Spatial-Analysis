# Shiny-App-for-Spatial-Analysis
The shiny application serves four purposes for the user:
1. The user can upload a shapfile, and the application then returns an interactive map of its location.
2. The application allows the user to select a SNOTEL site, and the application then returns interactive data plots for the selected SNOTEL site.
3. The application also allows the user to upload a MS-Excel CSV file to perform regression analysis. The user can select the dependent and independent variable(s), and the application then returns the result of the linear model. 
4. Lastly, the app then also returns the interactive plots based on the regression results for the user.
